Description:
   Simple shopping list program

   You are NOT submitting this program.
"""

"""
Instructions:

Write a program that allows a user to create and use a shopping list.  Your
program will display a menu of options to the user.  The user is free
to select any option from the menu in any order.

Extra Features once you are finished with the requirements below:
1) Allow the user to enter the number of each item they want to purchase.
2) Add a "checked" feature for each item. This will be used to indicate 
   if the item is checked off the list without removing it.


Sample Output:

Welcome to the shopping list program.
