# Setup for ThreeJS

ThreeJS will be used in the second half of the course.

In order to run a ThreeJS program, you need to include the ThreeJS library.  Here is a link to the [library file](three.min.js) that we will be using for the course.  Download this file to your computer and place it in the same folder of your program.
